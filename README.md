Shell City is a mod installer designed for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and Battle for Bikini Bottom on GameCube platforms, specifically optimized for Dolphin. If you are interested in distributing your mod in a format that is supported by Shell City, see below.

## Info For Mod Creators

The process of making your mod compatible with Shell City is to create a folder that contains the following:
```
Mod
 - files
   - b1
   - b2
   - b3
   - etc.
 - {game}.ini
 - cover.jpg
```

The .ini should appear to be something like this.

```ini
[Installer]
Game={Base Game Name}
Name={Mod Name}
Authors={Author}
Description={Description}
Directory=files
Image=cover.jpg
```

An image is not required, and as such the "Image" field can be left empty. All other fields are required, and your ini will not load properly should it be formatted incorrectly.

For example, here is how your files should look in File Explorer.

![File Explorer](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/603730493074046978/867168173807239178/unknown.png)

And here's how your ini file should look:

```ini
[Installer]
Game=Battle for Bikini Bottom
Name=BFBBMix
Authors=skyweiss
Description=Fan-made remix of Battle for Bikini Bottom.
Directory=files
Image=cover.jpg
```
